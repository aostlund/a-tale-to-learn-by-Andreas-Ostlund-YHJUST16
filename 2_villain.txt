Since time never stops, everything was out of schedule and not in the right order. 
One had to either play with his way or 'take the highway'. 
Also, Time's short and stressing pet Sprint is not making things better, they are always right there.
Time has the weapon of going by faster than expected. Especially when you're having fun, so don't have fun.
